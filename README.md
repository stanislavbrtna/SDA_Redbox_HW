# SDA OS base for the Red SDA
This repo contains modern SDA_OS base for the Red SDA and the Paper-box SDA.
Last version of SDA_OS for Red SDA was 0.6.x, since then I moved to the SDA Wonder hw. This repo is backported OS base to the Red box so it can run modern SDA_OS. 

## Getting started
I use Eclipse with codesourcery arm toolchain and this repo is basically the project folder. I use pretty old versions of those tools and I don't remember how to reproduce my exact setup, however I will try to replicate and document my setup in the near future, until then this repo is mainly for looking.

### Other info
If you want more info about the SDA_OS, you can start with [SDA_OS readme](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/SDA_OS/blob/master/README.md) and [SVS readme](https://github.com/stanislavbrtna/svs-script/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).
